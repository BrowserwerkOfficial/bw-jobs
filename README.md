## Introduction for editors

This extension ships with five different record types:

- Job Positions
- Employment Types
- Contact Persons
- Locations
- Categories

To create a **Job Position**, first create a **Location** and assign one or more **Contact Persons** to it. Then, create an **Employment Type**.
Lastly, create a **Job Position** and assign the created **Location** as well as the **Employment Type** to it. You can optionally create a **Category** and assign it to the **Job Position** as well.

## Translations

The following translations are available by default:

- English
- German

Contributions for adding additional languages are always welcome.

## Sitemap

Add the following TypoScript to output job positions in the TYPO3 sitemap:

```
plugin.tx_seo {
    config {
        xmlSitemap {
            sitemaps {
                jobs {
                    provider = TYPO3\CMS\Seo\XmlSitemap\RecordsXmlSitemapDataProvider
                    config {
                        table = tx_bwjobs_domain_model_jobposition
                        sortField = date_posted
                        lastModifiedField = tstamp
                        pid = 000 # Change this to the pid storing the job positions (same as storagePid)
                        url {
                            pageId = 000 # Change this to the pid containing the detail view plugin
                            fieldToParameterMap {
                                uid = tx_bwjobs_detail[jobPosition]
                            }
                            additionalGetParameters {
                                tx_bwjobs_detail.controller = JobPosition
                                tx_bwjobs_detail.action = show
                            }
                            useCacheHash = 1
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Structured data

This extension outputs structured JSON-LD data for job positions.
If you wish to disable it, override the **Show** template and remove the bw:structuredData ViewHelper at the very bottom of this template.

## Overriding Fluid templates

To override the default Fluid templates used by the extension, simply set the following TypoScript constants to the desired paths:

```
# Detail view
plugin.tx_bwjobs_detail.view.templateRootPath = EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Templates/
plugin.tx_bwjobs_detail.view.partialRootPath = EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Partials/
plugin.tx_bwjobs_detail.view.layoutRootPath = EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Layouts/

# List view
plugin.tx_bwjobs_list.view.templateRootPath = EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Templates/
plugin.tx_bwjobs_list.view.partialRootPath = EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Partials/
plugin.tx_bwjobs_list.view.layoutRootPath = EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Layouts/

# Backend module
module.tx_bwjobs_jobs.view.templateRootPath = EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Backend/Templates/
module.tx_bwjobs_jobs.view.partialRootPath = EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Backend/Partials/
module.tx_bwjobs_jobs.view.layoutRootPath = EXT:my_extension/Resources/Private/Backend/Layouts/
```

> This will not completely disable the default templates, it just allows you to override them from your own extension. If you wish to add more than just one additional path, use the TypoScript setup for *plugin.tx_bwjobs_detail.view*, *plugin.tx_bwjobs_list.view* and *module.tx_bwjobs_jobs.view* instead.

## Customizing the default styles

The following CSS Custom Properties are available for you to override from your own stylesheet:

```css
:root {
    /* This is the font size used as base by the custom styling from this extension */
    --bw-jobs-font-size--base: 16px;

    /* You can override these custom properties to change the colors */
    --bw-jobs-color--primary: var(--bs-primary);
    --bw-jobs-color--light: var(--bs-light);
}
```

> Please note: Because of the usage of modern CSS features, the default styling is not compatible with Internet Explorer 11.

## Disabling the default styles

This extension ships with Bootstrap 5 and some additional custom styling.
To disable these styles, unset the includes via TypoScript:

```
page.includeCSSLibs.bwJobsBootstrap >
page.includeCSS.bwJobs >
```

## Customizing the emails

To customize the emails sent by this extension, set the following TypoScript constants to the desired paths in your own extension:

| Constant Name | Default Value | Description |
| ------ | --- | ----------- |
| emailTemplateRootPath | EXT:bw_jobs/Resources/Private/Templates/Email/ | The path Fluid email templates are stored in. |
| emailLayoutRootPath | EXT:bw_jobs/Resources/Private/Layouts/Email/ | The path Fluid email layouts are stored in. |

Make sure these files exist in the new template path:

- EmailToApplicant.html
- EmailToApplicant.txt
- EmailToContactPerson.html
- EmailToContactPerson.txt

You can copy theses files from Resources/Private/Templates/Email.

The new layout path can be kept empty, but you are free to add custom layouts there as well.

> The default application form is configured to use FluidEmail by default. If you want to change this, see below for instructions on how to customize the application form.

## Customizing the application form

You can override the default YAML used for rendering the application form by setting the following TypoScript constant to point to your own form definition YAML:

| Constant Name | Default Value | Description |
| ------ | --- | ----------- |
| formPersistenceIdentifier | EXT:bw_jobs/Resources/Private/Forms/jobApplication.form.yaml | The path to the form YAML used for rendering the frontend application form. |

> Make sure to take a look inside the default template in Resources/Private/Templates/Frontend/Apply.html to see which values are set dynamically from inside Fluid.
